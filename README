OneTime for Yubikey
http://zetetic.net/software-onetime

OneTime makes it easy to use a Yubikey USB device with Google 2-step verification and other OATH-TOTP applications on your Mac. Unlike Google Authenticator or SMS delivery, a Yubikey with OneTime is super portable and doesn't require a smartphone, cell coverage, or SMS service. 

Best of all, OneTime does not make you re-type passwords from your device into login fields on the computer!

Key Features

- Works with GMail - Setup Google 2-step verification "out of the box" in 5 minutes
- Global Hotkey - Insert One Time Passwords at cursor location and submit, all without touching the mouse or typing a password
- Always On - Automatically starts-up on login and runs in the background in the Mac OSX Task Bar
- Yubikey Personalization - Program your Yubikey directly in the preference panel, no separate applications or conversion tools required.
- Full OATH-TOTP support - Not using GMail? OneTime can use a custom number of digits and time-step to support virtually any OATH-TOTP application

Note: This product requires a Yubikey hardware token. Buy one from Yubico to use OneTime.
